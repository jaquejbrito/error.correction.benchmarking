The 3 files in this directory are artificially created in order to asses the accuracy of the eval.py script.

Each sequence in the file will specify the result that the script should produce at the read level and the base pair level.

The script will perform operations to asses these files and aggregate the results for the set, producing totals:
    Read count (FP, FN, TN, TP) which should total to the number of sequences in the file.
    Base count (FP, FN, TN, TP) which should total to the number of basepairs in the true.fastq file.
